# ðŸ‘® 2FA App Clone

This project replicates a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) app like [Duo](https://duo.com/), [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki), and [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/security/mobile-authenticator-app).

## :book: Learnings

I'm curious how products, apps and services I use every day are engineered. I figured a 2FA app clone helps explore multiple skills at once like mobile development, APIs, server-side development, cryptography and time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs).
